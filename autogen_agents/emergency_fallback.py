The Kenya Health AI system is currently experiencing technical difficulties with external AI services. 

What's happening:
- Both Groq and Hugging Face APIs are temporarily unavailable
- The system has switched to emergency fallback mode
- Basic cached responses are available for common queries

Available Information:
- General statistics about Kenya's 107,000 CHWs
- Historical performance data for Kisumu, Busia, and Vihiga counties
- Basic family planning and immunization metrics
- Cached reports and visualizations

Recommended Actions:
1. Try again in a few minutes
2. For urgent queries, contact your county health management team
3. Check the system status dashboard for updates

We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to restore full functionality.''',
