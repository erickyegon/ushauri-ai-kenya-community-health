## Kenya Health AI System - Community Health Worker Intelligence Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Status:** Active Development  
**Project Code:** CHW-AI-KE  

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

The Kenya Health AI System is an intelligent analytics platform designed to enhance community health worker (CHW) performance monitoring and decision-making across Kisumu, Busia, and Vihiga counties. The system leverages AutoGen 0.6+ multi-agent architecture with Groq and HuggingFace APIs to provide real-time insights, predictive analytics, and automated reporting for health system optimization.

## üåç Problem Statement

### Kenya's Community Health Context
Kenya has made significant investments in community health through the **Kenya Community Health Strategy 2020-2025**, recruiting and equipping **107,000 Community Health Promoters (CHPs)** nationwide. The government has committed **Ksh.3 billion** for CHP stipends and launched the national **electronic Community Health Information System (e-CHIS)** for data collection via Android devices.

### Current Challenges
1. **Data Utilization Gap**: While e-CHIS collects comprehensive data from 107K CHPs, county health managers lack advanced analytics tools to derive actionable insights
2. **Performance Management Complexity**: Managing and analyzing performance data for thousands of CHPs across multiple counties requires sophisticated tools
3. **Decision Support Limitations**: Current systems provide data but limited intelligence for strategic decision-making
4. **Resource Optimization**: Need for AI-driven insights to optimize training, resource allocation, and intervention strategies
5. **Real-time Analytics Gap**: Delay between data collection in e-CHIS and actionable insights for county managers

### Impact on Kenya's Health System
- **Scale Challenge**: 107K CHPs generate massive data volumes requiring intelligent analysis
- **County-Level Gaps**: County health managers need localized insights from national e-CHIS data
- **Investment ROI**: Maximize return on government's Ksh.3 billion CHP investment through better performance management
- **UHC Goals**: Support Kenya's Universal Health Coverage objectives through data-driven community health optimization

## üéØ Product Vision

**"Amplify Kenya's e-CHIS investment with AI-powered analytics that transform community health data into actionable insights for county health managers."**

### Mission
Bridge the gap between Kenya's national e-CHIS data collection and county-level decision-making by providing intelligent analytics that help county health managers optimize the performance of their 107,000 Community Health Promoters, supporting the Kenya Community Health Strategy 2020-2025 objectives.
